You can also read a file using ‘stdin’. To read a file using a script what you have to do is first use a while loop in which you will write the code to read the file line by line and printing that on the terminal. After closing the while loop using the keyword ‘done’, specify the path of the ‘stdin’ file’ < "${1:-/dev/stdin}" ’ as we are using it for reading a file. The script given below can be used for a better understanding of this concept.
